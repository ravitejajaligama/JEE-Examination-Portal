## Environment Setup 

To Run my project  :

1. Clone the Repository
Download and install Node.js from the official website:
https://nodejs.org/

2. Environment Variables
To run this project, you'll need to configure the following environment variables in backend/config.json:

mongodb.connectionString: Connection string for MongoDB
jwt.secret: Secret key used for JWT token generation

3. Install Dependencies
Backend:
```bash
  cd backend
  npm install
```
Frontend:
```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
```
User based Frontend:
```bash
  cd user-portal-frontend
  npm install
```
4. Run MongoDB
Make sure your MongoDB server is running. If you don't have it installed locally, you can use a cloud-based MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas.

To start MongoDB locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
mongod
5. Start the Backend Server
Now, navigate to the backend folder and run the server:

- cd online-exam-portal/backend
- npm start
This will start your backend API server, and it should be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (by default).

6. Start the Frontend (Admin Portal)
For the admin portal, navigate to the frontend folder and run the following:

- cd online-exam-portal/frontend
- npm start
This will start the admin portal on http://localhost:3001 (by default).

7. Start the Frontend (Teacher/Student Portal)
For the teacher/student portal, navigate to the user-portal-frontend folder and run the following:

- cd online-exam-portal/user-portal-frontend
- npm start
This will start the teacher/student portal on http://localhost:3002 (by default).

8. Default Admin Login
Once you start the backend for the first time, the default admin credentials are created automatically. You can log in using these default credentials:

Username: sysadmin
Password: systemadmin
You can modify these credentials in the addAdminIfNotFound() function located in backend/services/admin.js if needed.

9. Access the Application
Now, you can access your application by visiting the following URLs in your browser:

Admin Portal: http://localhost:3001
Teacher/Student Portal: http://localhost:3002



## Current Status of my project
The backend is fully set up for test creation and attempts.

The frontend for admin is done.

In the user-portal-frontend, the Teacher Register Page is not yet completed.

Once the Teacher Register and Login Pages are implemented, the full functionality of the system will be available.
